**5.4.1 - Calling Functions**

Use the [numpy package](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_random_normal.asp) to sample the normal distribution a certain number of times.
The number of samples is selectable by you. After sampling the distribution, use the [mean()](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html) and [std()](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) methods
built in to numpy to check the mean and std of the samples match the original distribution.

**5.4.2 - Functional Dot Product**

In this assignment you will write your first function. It is encouraged that you complete the dot product assignment
from Module 4 before proceeding as that solution will be utilized.

Complete the implementation of the function "dot_product" that returns the dot product of two lists passed
as parameters to the function. Your function should return the dot product of those lists.

**5.4.3 - Functional PI**
Recall the [Gaussâ€“Legendre_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm) used in the previous assignment.

Write a custom function called my_pi that will calculate the value of PI to an arbitrary level of precision. The function should take
the amount of acceptable error as the single parameter and should return your estimated value for PI as the result.
