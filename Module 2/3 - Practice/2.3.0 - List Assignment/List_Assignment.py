# How well do you understand lists, their functions, and how
# to slice them? Let's find out:

# First, create a list with the values
# 5, 10, 15, and 20, in that order:
fives_list = None

# Now, store the last value of the list in
# the variable tail:
tail = None

# Here is another list
new_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Insert a 0 to the front of the list, then
# append a 6 to the end of the list.
# Hint: Should be two lines of code


# Here is the another list:
slicing_list = ["Luke", "Leia", "Han", "Vader", "R2D2"]

# Store the first two elements in this new list:
first_two = None

# Store the last three elements in this list:
last_three = None

# Lastly, copy the whole list into this list:
slicing_copy = None
