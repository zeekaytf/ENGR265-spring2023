**2.4.1 - An Odd List**
In this assignment you will be provided a list that has an odd length. Use the len() method and the built-in Python
operators to determine the index of the "middle" element of the list. Once the middle index has been identified, then
use a list index operation [] to final the value of that middle element. 
For example, if a list of length 3 contained [a, b, c] then the middle element would be located at index 1 and would have a value of "b".

Hint: you may with to use the [integer floor division operator](https://www.learndatasci.com/solutions/python-double-slash-operator-floor-division/)
