**4.4.1 - Estimating PI**

Use the [Gaussâ€“Legendre_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm) to estimate the value of PI. 
The program should generally follow the steps in the Wikipedia article.

Step 1: Declare/set the initial values for a0, b0, t0, and p0

Step 2: Loop and re-calculate those variables for 10 iterations

Step 3: Once the loop is completed, save the result to variable "pi_estimate" 

**4.4.2 - Odd and Even Sorting**

Given a list nums, place all even numbers in a list called evens, and vice versa for the odd values.

**4.4.3 - Vectors**

Given two lists of integers with equal length, compute the dot product for the two "vectors".
Store the result in a value called "dot_product".

Recall that for two vectors A and B, the dot product is the summation of a0*b0 + a1*b1 + a2*b2 ....
