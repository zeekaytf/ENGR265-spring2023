**3.4.1 - Deviation Lists**
Given two lists, use the standard deviation function from numpy to determine
which language has the largest standard deviation. Usage will be [np.std()](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html)

Store the longest list in the object "longest_list_is"

**3.4.2 - Odds and Even Counting**
Given a list, count the number of even and odd numbers in the list. Your final answer should be stored in two variables: "num_odds" and "num_evens".

**3.4.3 - Pig Latin with Strings**
Given a string containing English words, translate the sentence into Pig Latin. Spilts() will separate a sting into a list of words. Your code will modify each word and then re-assemble into a final String. Utilize the following rules:

If word starts with consonant, place starting letter on tail and append ”ay”
If word start with vowel, append “vay”
If word is less than 3 letters, do not modify.
