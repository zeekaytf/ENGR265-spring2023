**7.4.1. - Reactive Strength Index**

The Reactive Stength Index (RSI) is a measure of how rapidly an athlete can change their momentum an direction.
In this assignment you will calculate the RSI from several human subject participants on both a force plate and accelerometer.

The key parameters to determine are the "Time of Flight" a person is in the air, and the "Time of Contact" they were on the ground.
With these values the RSI can be calculated.

Complete the template "drop-jump-template" to identify the time of flight and time of contact for an individual subject. 
Addtional data can be loaded from the data/drop-jump folder.

The calculate time of flight and time of contact for the force plate data is available in a README in data/drop-jump/force-plate.
Compare your results against that dataset and then upload your final solution to gradescope.

**7.4.2 - Tensile Strength Testing**

Complete several templates to implement various tensile testing methods. Each template should be completed in order as they build upon one another.

A: Complete the template to calculate stress from load/force and cross-section area

B: Copy your solution from Step 1 and then determine ultimate stress and strain

C: Copy your solution from Step 2 and calculate the elastic modulus

D: Determine Yield Strength in the Step 3 module

E: Submit the full template to Gradescope.
